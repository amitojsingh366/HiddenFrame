# CSCI 265 Initial Project Proposal

## Team name: YOUR TEAM NAME HERE

## Project/product name: HiddenFrame

## Contact person and email address
Patrick Candy - candy.pat@gmail.com

## Project Overview
Project HiddenFrame is, in brief, a picture board (like pintrest), that also acts as a secret message board by using steganography... (elaborate)

## Target audience and motivation
Provide a paragraph or two describing the target audience for the product and why they will be interested in it, and a paragraph or two describing your own team's interest/motivation for making this particular product.

HiddenFrame is intended to obstruficate hidden messages. The project has an application wherever, it is important that the passage of data go unremarked. In particular, this project has applications in journalism and policing.

## Key features and discussion
Provide a list of the key features of the product and a deeper discussion of the product in relation to those.  By the time the reader finishes this section they should have a strong idea of what your proposed product is all about.

The primary objective of the project is to create a picture board that is capable of data obstrufication. 

## Preliminary interface sketches

Provide a first rough draft of an interface (screens, menus, etc) to have a shared preliminary vision of the product look and feel.  Be sure to include some accompanying explanation to put the various sketches in perspective (never leave the reader wondering how the parts fit together).

make it look like pintrest.

## Scaling plans

Provide a short discussion of how the project can be scaled up/down in the future if it begins to look too large to complete on time or too small to provide a suitable challenge for the team.

If the project needs to be scaled down, we will focus on producing a progam that successfully completes the stenographic process, without the picture boarding included.

Ideas for scaling up, include 
    -supporting additonal input/output file types - eg: seeding a picture with audio instead of text or seeding an audio file with text.
    -getting the project to generate images instead of being provided with an image to seed.


## Risks and potential issues
Provide a list of anticipated problems/risks associated with the product design and development and the team's plans for how to deal with them.  (Organizational/team risks will be covered in the team charter.)

The team does not, overall, have a strong foundation in website creation.
