## Project Overview

Project HiddenFrame is, in brief, a picture board (like pintrest), that also acts as a secret message board by using steganography. HiddenFrame will be publicly accessible and encourage the general public to share photographic content; meanwhile select users will be using HiddenFrame's true capabilities to exchange pictures encoded with hidden data. 

HiddenFrame will achieve its purpose by first providing an attractive social media experience, in order to attract as many users as possible and thereby provide better obstrufucation for the secret messages. The secret messages, section of the site will access controlled and  

## Target audience and motivation

HiddenFrame is intended to obstruficate hidden messages. The project has an application wherever it is important that the passage of data go unremarked. In particular, this project has applications in journalism and policing; both situations where communication from sources covertly is important. Additionally, the project has potential uses in PEN testing.

Our team discussed a very diverse set of possible projects. We ultimately settled on this one because we felt that it had a great deal of variety. It will involve networking, web-design, image manipulation, and encryption (at a minimum). The hope is that this project will allow each member of the team to grow as a developer. 

## Key features and discussion

Provide a list of the key features of the product and a deeper discussion of the product in relation to those.  By the time the reader finishes this section they should have a strong idea of what your proposed product is all about.

### Social Site

The project 

## Preliminary interface sketches

Provide a first rough draft of an interface (screens, menus, etc) to have a shared preliminary vision of the product look and feel.  Be sure to include some accompanying explanation to put the various sketches in perspective (never leave the reader wondering how the parts fit together).

make it look like pintrest.

## Scaling plans

Provide a short discussion of how the project can be scaled up/down in the future if it begins to look too large to complete on time or too small to provide a suitable challenge for the team.

If the project needs to be scaled down: 
-we will focus on producing a progam that successfully completes the stenographic process, without the picture board site.

Ideas for scaling up, include: 
-supporting additonal input/output file types - eg: seeding a picture with audio instead of text or seeding an audio file with text.
-getting the project to generate images instead of being provided with an image to seed.


## Risks and potential issues

Provide a list of anticipated problems/risks associated with the product design and development and the team's plans for how to deal with them.  (Organizational/team risks will be covered in the team charter.)

The team does not, overall, have a strong foundation in website creation. Since a 'social media site' is a large portion of the functionality of this project, this knowledge cap could be a potential problem.
