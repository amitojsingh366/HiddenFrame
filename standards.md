## Document structure

In this document we will be addressing three core areas of standards and processes:
 - Documentation standards and processes
 - Coding standards and processes
 - Version control standards and processes

Each section includes discussion of how those standards/processes will be enforced, and how they will be reviewed for potential updates if/as needed.

## Documentation standards and processes

Detail the documentation standards and processes to be followed (can provide links to existing industry standards), how they will be enforced, and how they will be reviewed for updating if/as needed.

## Coding standards and processes

Detail the coding standards and processes to be followed (can provide links to existing industry standards), how they will be enforced, and how they will be reviewed for updating if/as needed.

## Version control standards and processes

The git lead will enforce these standards along with everyone else holding each other accountable:

- No pushing directly to [`master`](https://github.com/csci265-team/project/tree/master). Create pull requests instead.
- Pull requests need to be created against [`master`](https://github.com/csci265-team/project/tree/master) to get code merged in.
- At least two team members need to approve changes in a PR before code can be merged into [`master`](https://github.com/csci265-team/project/tree/master).
- The creator of the pull request can not merge their own pull request.
- Force pushes should be avoided.

Teams have been made on GitHub for eaech of the roles in this project.
A project page on GitHub is created to keep track of tasks. This is to be used by everyone to keep each other accountable.
