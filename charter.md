## Project intro

Provide one or two paragraphs outlining the product in general.

## Team philosophy

Our goals for this group project include improving our collaborative coding skills and experienece by working as team on a larger project than we're used to, improving our knowledge and experience with git and other coding tools. We have set the academic goal of 90% on the overall group project grade as a floor. Our priorities include meeting deadlines (see Deadlines and Deliverables) to allow sufficient time for team members to review eachother's work before submission deadlines are imminent.

Our team is committed to engaging with one another as active participants and respectfully in class, lab, and group discussions. Active participation includes regular attendance at class, labs and team meetings. Respectful communication includes active listening and participation in group discussions, and approaching discussions from a solutions oriented perspective.

## Team roles/responsibilities

 - how your team plans to divide up the roles/responsibilities for the project,
 - how you plan on adjusting those if/when the need arises (team members join or leave during the semester, individual team members turn out to be over/underworked based on the original allocation),
 - how new roles/responsibilities will be allocated as the need arises.

regarding participation (or lack thereof), workloads, design, project features, etc.
