## Project intro

Project HiddenFrame is, in brief, a picture board (like pintrest), that will use various technologies like DBMS, WebRTC, APIs and also acts as a secret message board by using stenography. HiddenFrame will be publicly accessible and encourage the general public to share photographic content; meanwhile select users will be using HiddenFrame's true capabilities to exchange pictures encoded with hidden data. (Which only a select few will know about)

## Team philosophy

Our goals for this group project include improving our collaborative coding skills and experienece by working as team on a larger project than we're used to, improving our knowledge and experience with git and other coding tools. We have set the academic goal of 90% on the overall group project grade as a floor. Our priorities include meeting deadlines [(see Deadlines and Deliverables)](#deadlines-and-deliverables) to allow sufficient time for team members to review eachother's work before submission deadlines are imminent.

Our team is committed to engaging with one another as active participants and respectfully in class, lab, and group discussions. Active participation includes regular attendance at class, labs and team meetings. Respectful communication includes active listening and participation in group discussions, and approaching discussions from a solutions oriented perspective.

## Planned team meeting time(s) and communication plans

The group will meet in the library at 2:30pm on Thursdays unless agreed beforehand in the team Discord chat that a team meeting will not be neccessary. Team members can also use phone calls to contact each other in urgent situations

Team members are expected to respond within 24 hours of a discord message and within 1 hour of a phone call.

Describe any rules for preparing for, running, tracking decisions made, and following up on meetings,
and how you'll handle situations where a team member is unable to attend a meeting.

In each meeting the team will discuss any deadlines or deliverables that need to be looked at. If any member is unable to attend the meeting they must inform the team before the meeting is held so alternate arrangements can be made. In case the meeting is held without the team member they can join on discord or get caught up on what was discussed by another team member.

## Deadlines and deliverables

Our meetings on Thursdays are when we decide on deliverables. We as a team will hold each other accountable. Deadlines and deliverables will be noted down by the Documentation team in the action item list.

Everyone on the team is expected to behave as reasonable adults. Therefore, it is acceptable if a team member is unable to meet a deadline or deliverable, provided they have a valid reason and have communicated this in advance.

If a team member repeatedly misses deadlines or deliverables without a valid reason, the issue will be escalated and discussed in meetings. If the team is unable to reach a resolution, we will consult the professor.

## Conflict resolution scheme

Decisions are made unanimously by the team. If not unanimous, team decisions will be made by majority vote where a quorum of six (6) is required in the team Discord chat, or a quorum of four (4) is required at the weekly team meeting [(see Planned Meeting Time(s) and Communication Plan)](#planned-team-meeting-times-and-communication-plans). In the event of a team vote resulting in a tie in either circumstance, a coin flip will decide the outcome of the vote.

Documentation team will track all proposed decisions and deadlines, incase Documentation team is unable to do so, another member of the team will take charge.

In the case of lack of participation or excess participation the team will discuss the member's participation during a meeting and then come with a plan to deal with the same. (Eg: Too little participation would get more tasks assigned, excess participation will get their tasks distributed among the rest of the team)

## Team Git policies

- No pushing directly to [`master`](https://github.com/csci265-team/project/tree/master).
- Pull requests need to be created against [`master`](https://github.com/csci265-team/project/tree/master) to get code merged in.
- At least two team members need to approve changes in a PR before code can be merged into [`master`](https://github.com/csci265-team/project/tree/master).
- The creator of the pull request can not merge their own pull request.
- Force pushes should be avoided.

## Team AI policies

- AI can be used to help in research
- AI can be used in identifying and fixing bugs. But the user must not copy paste fixes directly or at the least understand how the fix works so a similar bugs do not arise in the future.
- AI can be used to generate sample data
- AI **can NOT** be used to directly write code/features

## Discussion of team strengths/weaknesses

Our team has identified that we have varying backgrounds, skillsets, and experience. For example:

- Some team members have extensive experience with git, while others do not;
- Some team members have programming experience in multiple languages, while others do not; and
- Some team members have taken some time away form coding in favour of gaining other experience, while others have been working on coding projects more recently.

In one respect this is a strength in that we have a broad range of past experience. In another respect, this will require that team members with experience that will prove especially useful to a particular aspect of the project may need to explain their thinking to teammates who may have limited experience in that topic. We're committed to meeting this challenge by engaging respectfully with one another and ultimately improving our communication skills.
