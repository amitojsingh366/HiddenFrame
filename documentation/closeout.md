 Final updates:
- This section should detail any phase 6 changes to the requirements, design, standards, charter, and test plans.

End state of the product:(Amitoj & Artem)
- This section should detail the features and functionality that was successfully incorporated into the final product.
- It should also detail any core features and functionality that wasn't successfully incorporated into the final product, estimate how much work remains before these features could be completed, and make recommendations on what order they should be completed in (if the team had the time to complete them).

Review the organizational aspects of the project:(pat)
- This section should summarize the key organizational choices the team made (i.e. from the charter and standards documents) from the perspective of which ones worked well and how the team would do things differently given a 'do-over'.

Review the technical aspects of the project: (Jeremy)
- This section is much like the previous one, but this time focused on the design and implementation choices made by the team: which ones worked well and how would the team do things differently given the opportunity.
