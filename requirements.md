# CSCI 265 Requirements and specifications (Phase 2)

## Team name: Project HiddenFrame

## Project/product name: HiddenFrame

## Contact person and email

The following person has been designated the main contact person for questions from the reader:

 - NameA, their@emailaddy

## Introduction and overview

Provide the reader with an introduction to the product: its purpose, its core features, what audience it is aimed at and how they'll be using it, and what platform(s) it is targeting.

Project HiddenFrame is, in brief, a picture board (like Pinterest) that will use various technologies like DBMS, WebRTC, and APIs. It also acts as a secret message board by using steganography. HiddenFrame will be publicly accessible and encourage the general public to share photographic content; meanwhile, select users will be using HiddenFrame's true capabilities to exchange pictures encoded with hidden data. (Which only a select few will know about)

It targets the Web platform with a focus on desktop devices first and mobile devices as a strech goal.

If the product has limitations that the user wouldn't expect then those should be mentioned as well.  (For example, if we were building a calculator but it couldn't handle real number calculations then we should probably warn the reader about that.)

## Known issues/omissions

Currently HiddenFrame will allow uploading images with embedding hidden text messages in the same images.
Our strech goals include:

- Uploading images with secret embedded audio
- Uploading images with secret embedded images
- Uploading videos with secret embedded text
- Uploading videos with secret embedded audio
- Uploading vidoes with secret embedded images


## Product features and behaviour

This might be much like our original proposal but in far greater detail: we want to thoroughly explain/describe all aspects of the product's functionality: all the features and every aspect of its behaviour.

Here the reader should should be able to find the answer for any question along the lines of
- How do I use feature X?
- How do I enter data value Y?
- What are the limits (if any) on what I enter for Z?
- What does the product do if I enter an incorrect value?
- What happens when I select W?"

This section should be intuitive to follow if the reader is simply reading through the document to learn about the product, but it should also make it easy for the reader to quickly look up the answer to any specific question.

## User interface and navigation

### Home page 

![A depection of the public home page](<resources/images/HiddenFrame Public View.png>)
The home page will have all the previously uploaded images by different users.
Provide visual depictions of every screen, menu, drop-down, pop-up, etc.  This isn't intended to be a to-the-pixel exact representation, but it is expected to show all the visible elements and options, and their approximate positions and appearance.

Accompany each visual depiction with a clear description of what it shows and what each visible option represents.

Provide a navigation guide/map and description that show how all the screens/menus etc relate to one another: i.e. clearly showing/describing how the user navigates from screen-to-screen and which screens/choices lead to which others.

## Use cases/scenarios

Provide use cases detailing the different ways someone might actually want to use the product (e.g. a "sign in" use case, a "check balance" use case, a "make a deposit" use case, etc).

Provide scenarios that illustrate the use cases in a practical example.  (E.g. Bob has $30 to deposit and wants to deposit it, check the balance, and if there is enough then transfer $100 to his savings account, ... then walk through the Bob's actions from sign-in to sign-out.)

## Non-functional requirements

Detail any requirements beyond the actual feature set previously required, e.g.
- safety/security/privacy requirements
- performance requirements (response times, throughput, memory footprint)
- software quality requirements

## Feature prioritization

Much like the scaling section in the original proposal, here we must document which features are regarded as essential, which ones are secondary priorities, and which ones are 'nice to have' but low priority for this term.

## Glossary

Define any product-specific terms and any terms that are unlikely to be known to the 'average' reader (e.g. a random second-year CS student).

## Appendices

If additional supported documents are needed then append them here
